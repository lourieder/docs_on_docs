Editing Documentation
=====================

The documentation format we use is Restructured Text, often
abbreviated "ReST" or ".rst" as a file extension. It is very similar
to Markdown, but more powerful since it has some extra features. But
basically, it is just plain unformatted text. Headlines can be done
with a "#" or "##" in front of the title, bold text is produced by
embracing the text with "**", italics are created by "__". There's a
lot of external documentation on the details (https://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.io/step-1/).
