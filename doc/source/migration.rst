=================

  
1. Cone docs-exports repository 

  To start the Migration Process you have to clone the Docs-Exports
  This can be achived with the following command:
  
.. code-block::

  git clone https://github.com/opentelekomcloud-docs/doc-exports


2. Run the Conversion Script

  In the Doc-Export Repository is a Script which is used to convert the HTML files to the new format. 

  The script can be run with the following comand:
  
.. code-block::

  python3 process.py xxx/umn/
  
Note: you have to change the file directory xxx/umn/ to your dirctive. 


3. Contact Ecosystem Squad
 
  Ecosystem Squad will gladly assist you with the next step:
  They handle creating a repoitory for your spefic service for a ready to use Enviorment. 


4. Clone your new Repository.

  After your repoistory was created you have to clone it. 
  
  The script can be run with the following comand:
  
.. code-block::

  git clone https://github.com/opentelekomcloud-docs/xxx


5. Import conversion results 

  For the next step you need to know where you saved the Doc Doc-Export Repository. 

  The file path to the Doc Export is needed for the following command:
  
.. code-block::

  cp -av file_path/doc-exports/xxx/umn/result umn/source

  cp -av file_path/doc-exports/xxx/umn/*.{png,gif,svg} umn/source/_static/images


Note: Depending on your Documentation you will use /umn/ or /api-ref/

umn is for usermanuals 

api-ref is for API Reference

xxx would stand for your service
    
6. Try to build imported files locally

    To ensure the conversion build isnÂ´t broken you have to build them locally. 
    Depening on the type of documents you can use following commands: 

    .. code-block::

        tox -e umn 

        tox -e api-ref
