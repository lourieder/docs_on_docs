How to join GitHub
---------------------
1.	Got to https://github.com/
2.	On the top right corner is a button with “sign up”
3.	Enter your corporate Email and press continue
4.	Create strong and memorable password
5.	Enter a username e.g.  joedoe
6.	Would you like to receive updates? I suggest opting out with entering “n”
7.	Verify your account by solving the task to prove you aren´t a bot
8.	Hit a “create an account”
9.	You are almost done! GitHub just sent you a launch you that has to be entered to create the account ultimately. Note: The Code has to be entered manually and can´t be entered via “copy & paste” 
10.	You are asked with how many people you are working with and if you are a student or a teacher. This personalization can be skipped at the bottom of the Website. I would suggest skipping this step. 
11.	Congratulations you just created you GitHub account
