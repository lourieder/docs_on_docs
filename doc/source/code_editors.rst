-Intellij

	Intellij is a IDE for Java programming 
	Intellij has so called deep intelligence by giving relevant suggestions in every context by analyzing your source code

  	Although, RST hast to be installed at https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7124-restructuredtext/versions

  	For Better creation and reformation of tables in RST using Vim use the following Plugin

-Nano
	Next Editor is also targeted at more experienced users that aren´t interested in nice UI Designs. 
	But I wouldn´t recommend using Nano because there are no RST Plugins for Nano
	
	-Atom
	Atom greets you with the promise being “a hackable text editor for the 21st Century”
